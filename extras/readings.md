# Great Readings

This document consists of great books or articles on Latin.
Some are here because there is a course covering the same material;
some are just great books that you should read at some point in your career.

Once you have made it through most of the curriculum, knowing whether a book is worth your time will become easier.
Or, if you are struggling in one of the courses, perhaps reading a book on the subject will help.
