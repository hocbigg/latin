# Other curricula

This curriculum is one of a few efforts to inform learners how they can pursue Latin independently. Below are a few other such efforts.

- [Textkit Greek and Latin Forums Resources](https://www.textkit.com/) (community-driven guides and public domain texts)
- [Ranieri-Roberts Approach to Ancient Greek (Luke Ranieri Spreadsheet)](http://bit.ly/ranieri-roberts-approach) (structured self-study sequence with readers)
- [Paideia Institute Online Programs](https://www.paideiainstitute.org/online_programs) (synchronous courses, some free materials)
- [Dickinson College Commentaries Self-Study Guides](https://dcc.dickinson.edu/) (annotated texts for independent reading)
