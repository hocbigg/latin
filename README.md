# Summary

The Latin curriculum is a **complete education in Latin** using online materials.

**The resource page** can be found here: [latin/resources](resources.md).

## Organization

The structure follows a logical progression:

- **Intro Latin**: Build foundational language skills.
- **Core Latin**: Develop proficiency in reading authentic texts and understanding Roman literature/history.
- **Advanced Latin**: Pursue specialization tracks for deeper engagement.
- **Capstone**: Apply knowledge through independent work.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These four sections form the essential backbone of the curriculum. Work through them sequentially, completing each one before moving to the next. They will give you the ability to read, understand, and appreciate real Latin texts with confidence.

1. **I. Foundations of Latin (Complete Beginner)**  
   Start here. This section teaches pronunciation, basic grammar, and reading skills using the most beginner-friendly method available.

2. **II. Structural Mastery of Latin Grammar**  
   Next. Here you gain systematic control of grammar and syntax, and begin reading slightly longer and more authentic prose passages.

3. **III. Transition to Authentic Latin Texts**  
   After the previous section. You now read real, unadapted Roman prose (especially from the Republican and early Imperial periods) with commentary and support.

4. **IV. Latin Poetry and Literary Technique**  
   Follows directly after Section III. This introduces the reading of Latin poetry, meter, and the major poetic genres, completing the core reading skills needed for most university-level Latin study.

### Specialization Tracks

The remaining sections are deeper or more focused extensions. You should only begin them **after** you have completed the Core (at least through Section IV). Pick one or more based on your personal interests:

- **V. Advanced Prose, Rhetoric, and Style**  
  For those who want to read more complex historical, philosophical, and rhetorical Latin, or who are interested in writing Latin prose themselves.

- **VI. Linguistics, Philology, and Textual Studies**  
  For those curious about how Latin works as a language, its historical development, its place in Indo-European, or the study of ancient inscriptions and manuscripts.
